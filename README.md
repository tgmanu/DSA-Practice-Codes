# 📘 DSA Practice Codes

This repository documents my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** by solving problems and improving my logic building skills.

I am currently practicing DSA step-by-step and will continue updating this repository as I learn new concepts.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

* Learn DSA from basics to advanced
* Build strong problem-solving skills
* Practice regularly for coding interviews
* Track my learning progress publicly

---

## 💻 Languages Used

* Python 🐍
* Java ☕

(Solutions may be implemented in either or both languages depending on practice)

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Problems will be organized topic-wise as I progress:

```

## 🧠 Learning Approach

For each problem I try to:

1. Understand brute force solution
2. Improve to optimized solution
3. Learn time & space complexity
4. Implement in Python / Java

## ▶️ How to Run Code

### Python

```bash
python filename.py
```

### Java

```bash
javac filename.java
java filename
```
